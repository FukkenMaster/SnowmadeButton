CLICK (for short press) and TICK (for long press) events in a non-blocking way. 
Buttons should use hardware debounce, software substitude is not included and not recomended. 


## Examples
```arduino
import { ProjectModule } from 'yourproject';

const pm = new ProjectModule();

pm.doSomethingCool('parameter');
